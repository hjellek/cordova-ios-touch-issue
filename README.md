cordova-ios-touch-issue
=======================
Small project to illustrate an issue on iPhone 6 with iOS 8.

The app contains one page that registers different touch events (through hammerjs).
When dragging right, it is possible to drag the finger slowly off screen and never receiving the dragend event.
